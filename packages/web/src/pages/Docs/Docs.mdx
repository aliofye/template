# Motivation
Throughout the years, We saw many developers struggle with the same issues:
* Non-existent or poorly written documentation for API endpoints
* No typescript adoption
* Highly decoupled codebases
* Very slow test runs
* Poor developer experience
* Hard to deploy

So we set out to resolve these issues by creating a monorepo with the following goals:
* Type safety out of the box with TypeScript
* Fast running tests
* A single codebase for backend and frontend
* Automatic API documentation generation
* Easy to deploy
* A great developer experience


# Why not [Insert Framework Here]?
Short answer, because we don't want to.
We wanted to build something flexible, don't like React? swap it out for Vue. 

Don't like Express? swap it out for Fastify, Koa or the million other web frameworks.


# Overview
In this monorepo you will find the following packages: `api` and `web`

These packages contain your backend and frontend code respectively.

## Runtime
We use `Bun` as our runtime for both the backend and frontend. 

Main benefits: blazingly fast and a drop-in replacement for Node.js.

## Database
We use `Drizzle` as our ORM. It is a TypeScript ORM for SQL databases.

Main benefits: type safety, sql like queries and a great developer experience.

## Backend
We use `Hono` as our web framework. It is a fast and lightweight web framework for Bun.

Main benefits: fast and lightweight, 0 dependencies, and RPC like developer experience using `hono/client`.

## Frontend
We use `React` as our frontend framework. It is a popular and widely used frontend framework.

We use `Vite` for our build tool. It is a fast and lightweight build tool for modern web applications.

Main benefits: large community, easy to use, production ready framework.

## Containerization
We use `Docker` for containerization.

Main benefits: easy to deploy, and no more "it works on my machine" issues.
