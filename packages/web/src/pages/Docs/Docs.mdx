# Motivation

Over the years, we’ve observed several common challenges faced by developers:

- **Poor API Documentation**: Many API endpoints lack sufficient or well-structured documentation.
- **No TypeScript Adoption**: Many projects miss out on TypeScript’s benefits, leading to potential runtime issues.
- **Highly Decoupled Codebases**: Projects often become difficult to manage due to overcomplicated separation between components.
- **Slow Test Runs**: Inefficient test setups lead to long testing cycles, hindering development speed.
- **Poor Developer Experience**: Developers often face difficulties in terms of usability, tooling, and workflow.
- **Difficult Deployments**: Deployment processes can be complex and error-prone, leading to frustration.

To address these issues, we created a monorepo with the following key goals:

- **Type Safety with TypeScript**: Providing type safety out of the box for both the backend and frontend.
- **Fast Test Execution**: Optimizing the test runs for quicker feedback and smoother development.
- **Unified Codebase**: A single codebase to manage both the backend and frontend, reducing complexity.
- **Automatic API Documentation**: Generating API documentation automatically to ensure up-to-date and accurate docs.
- **Easy Deployments**: Simplifying the deployment process to make it faster and less error-prone.
- **Great Developer Experience**: Focusing on an intuitive and efficient experience for developers.

# Why Not [Insert Framework Here]?

### The Short Answer: We Didn’t Want To

We decided to build something flexible and customizable. Rather than relying on a single framework that might impose constraints on the project, we made sure our solution allows you to:

- **Swap Frontend Frameworks**: Don’t like React? Swap it out for Vue or any other framework you prefer.
- **Change Web Frameworks**: Prefer Fastify, Koa, or another web framework over Hono? The flexibility is built in.

# Overview

This monorepo consists of the following primary packages:

- **`api`**: Contains all backend-related code.
- **`web`**: Contains all frontend-related code.

These packages are structured to support both backend and frontend development in a seamless and unified environment.
