# Motivation
Throughout the years, We saw many developers struggle with the same issues:
* Non-existent or poorly written documentation for API endpoints
* No typescript adoption
* Highly decoupled codebases
* Very slow test runs
* Poor developer experience
* Hard to deploy

So we set out to resolve these issues by creating a monorepo with the following goals:
* Type safety out of the box with TypeScript
* Fast running tests
* A single codebase for backend and frontend
* Automatic API documentation generation
* Easy to deploy
* A great developer experience


# Why not [Insert Framework Here]?
Short answer, because we don't want to.
We wanted to build something flexible, don't like React? swap it out for Vue. 

Don't like Hono? swap it out for Fastify, Koa or the million other web frameworks.


# Overview
In this monorepo you will find the following packages: `api` and `web`

These packages contain your backend and frontend code respectively.
